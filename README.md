### Scripts for the paper "Analysis of the selection pressure of SARS-CoV-2 virus genes helps to analyze their most exposed protein regions as well as their overlapping genes"

In this work we have been able to measure the selective pressure of all the described SARS-CoV-2 genes, even analyzed by sequence regions, and we show how this type of analysis allows us to separate the genes between those subject to positive selection (usually those that code for surface proteins or those exposed to the host immune system) and those subject to negative selection because they require greater conservation of their structure and function.
